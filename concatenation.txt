What is concatenation
Method of concatenation
inbuilt python function (At least 5)

Answer
Concatenation is a process of combining two or more strings into a single larger string. It's an important in programming and computing because it allows you to store and combine multiple piece of data when needed.

Method of Concatenation

Concatenation is the process of appending one string to the end of another string. You concatenation strings by using the + operator, using join() String concatenation using percentage % operator
String concatenation using format () function
String concatenation using f-strings
String concatenation using + operator

Inbuilt python function;
(1) abs() Return the absolute value of a number. The argument may be an integer, a floating point number or an object implementing
(2) aiter() Return an asynchronous iterator for an asynchronous iterable. Equivalent to calling x._aiter_() unlike iter(), aiter() has no two-argument variant
(3) any(iterable) Return true if any element odf the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty return False.
def any(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element:
            return True
    return False

(4) ascii()
As repr(), return a string containing a printable representation of an object, but escape the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by repr() using /x, /u, or /U escape. This generates a string similar to that returned by repr() in python 2

(5) bin(x) Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with "ob". The result is valid python expression. If x is not a python int object, it has to define an _index_() method that return an integer.
bin(3)
'0b11'
bin(-10)
'-0b1010

format(14, '#b'), format(14, 'b')
('0b1110', '1110')
f'{14:#b}', f'{14:b}'
('0b1110', '1110')

class bool(object=False, /)
Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of True or False. The argument is converted using the standard truth testing procedure. If the argument is false or omitted, this returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The bool class is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types — int, float, complex). It cannot be subclassed further. Its only instances are False and True (see Boolean Type - bool).
